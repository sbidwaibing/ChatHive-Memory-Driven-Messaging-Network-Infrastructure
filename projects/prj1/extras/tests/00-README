This directory contains two kinds of files:

  : `*.test` :
    A file containing a test which is expected to succeed.
    If the basename ends with `-err`, then stderr is expected to
    contain error message lines starting with a `:`-terminated error
    code prefix.

  : `*.out` :
    A file containing the expected output for the corresponding
    `*.test` file.  All error lines are replaced by their error
    code prefixes.
