Largely a reimplementation of Project 3, in fact the guts of the code
is repurposed from Project 3.

Uses 2 threads in client: the main thread which reads the terminal and
an auxiliary thread which largely copies the server response to the
terminal.  When a user types in a command, the main thread sends it to
the server and forgets about it.  The auxiliary thread will pick up
any server response.

The server too is multi-threaded.  The main thread simply listens on the
server socket.  When a connection is accepted, it is dispatched on
a client thread.  The main thread stores an array of thread-infos for
all possible client threads.  When a client thread wants to broadcast
a message to a room it scans this array selecting only active client
threads for the room (not equal to itself).
